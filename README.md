## 相关组件
在默认端口（6379）开启Redis：
```bash
redis-server
```

在MySQL里建立scheme，名为`reconstruction`，在其下建立一张`user`表，四个字段是`username`、`password`、`email`、`company`，都是字符串就行了，我这里是`varchar(20)`。

开启MySQL服务，用管理员身份打开CMD，执行：
```
net start mysql
```

如要关闭Redis，执行：
```
redis-cli shutdown
```


## Introduction

Page preview: Unavailable.

Tool aims to generate developing order during the design phase, and realize the transformation tool from UML diagrams to phase tree, so as to better analyze user needs and reduce design standards.

Both static export (including PDF and SVG formats) and dynamic support (web and mobile access) is supported.

Warranty is supported according to Github. If bugs are reported, fixing and strengthening this project is possible if time's allowed. To report the problem, please open (or create) an issue at this project on the GitHub. Contact us by [email](10165101169@stu.ecnu.edu.cn) if eaging to get response.


## Future

- [ ] Upload languages can be expanded from SysML to UML, and more.

- [ ] Since different softwares provide different encoding formats of modeling language, we will try to compatitable for more softwares. 

- [ ] Algorithm for refactoring may change and optimize later. For better experience, we'll keep both versions (for users to choose) until stable version is published.

## Technology Stack

Website: vue2 + vue-router + npm + ES6 + ajax + json + redis

Server: Jama + graphviz (static output) + Spring Boot

Test Framework: JUnit + Mockito + Hamcrest + Coverage Runner (reports will be supported in the future)

For the website part of this project, see [here](github.com/ivyee17/software-reconstruction-website).

## Deployment

1. Open redis with localhost:6379
2. Open mysql with table username (defined in dao.user)
3. Make sure server port 8091 is not used by other apps
4. Load SpringBoot with Java
5. Enjoy!
